*American Religious Ecologies* is a project of the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org) that is creating new datasets, maps and visualizations for the history of American religion. With the [generous support](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=PW-264050-19) of the National Endowment for the Humanities, we are currently digitizing the 1926 U.S. Census of Religious Bodies, which has individual schedules for approximately 232,000 congregations. We are also investigating denominational records and other sources of data.
